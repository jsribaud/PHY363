    "### The Course\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics III is an opportunity to expand your understanding of the universe by leveraging the foundational knowledge you have developed in your introductory physics and mathematics courses. The physics content of the course is focused on the various developments of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, typically referred to as *Modern Physics*. This includes Relativity, atomic and subatomic physics, particle physics, and Quantum Mechanics, among many others. In addition to the content, we will also explore the people and stories behind this myriad of developments through our reading of *Quantum*. This will allow our class meetings to span the detailed and technical treatment neccesary explore Modern Physics, along with thoughtful discussions of the historical, social, and cultural context in which these developments have occurred.

Typically problem sets will be due 1-week after they have been assigned. Further details, including grading, will be discussed in class."
