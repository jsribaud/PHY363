Most weeks you will work in pairs to complete some of the most influential experiments that ushered in Modern Physics. As this is an advanced lab, the expectations are for your lab reports to resemble professional manuscripts in format, language, and analysis techniques.  "

In addition to attendance, your lab grade will be determined primarily by the quality of your submitted manuscripts/reports. Reports will need to be pushed to the Github repository by the start of lab the week following a completed experiment (there will be no exception to the submission deadline). One report, per group, will be submitted and the grade earned will be the same for all group members. Your submitted report should make clear the contributions from each group member. Group members who fail to contribute substantively to the submitted report will receive 0% for the report."
