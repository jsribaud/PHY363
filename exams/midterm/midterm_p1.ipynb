    "The Ladder Paradox (LP) is a famous problem in special relativity. In the LP, a ladder parallel to the ground is moving horizontally towards a garage with an open door. If the proper length of the garage is 10.0 m and the proper length of the ladder is 20.0 m, at what speed would an observer in the garage claim the ladder is moving if the ladder fits inside the garage?\n",

    "The LP is a paradox because an observer traveling with the ladder will note the ladder DOES NOT fit inside the garage - provide an explanation for these two apparently different conclusions (according to one observer, the ladder fits - while to a second oberver, the ladder does not fit)."
