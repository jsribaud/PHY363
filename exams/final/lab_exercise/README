The data file provided in this directory has distance and velocity estimates for various nearby galaxies. This is data similar to what Edwin Hubble analyzed to determine the universe is expanding. 

Use the data to re-create the Hubble Law plot (velocity vs. distance) and determine the Hubble constant. Hubble's Law is v = H_0 d, where H_0 is the Hubble constant. In the data file, the distance is provided in Mpc (mega parsecs) and the velocity is provided in km/s.

As a bonus, use your value for the Hubble constant to estimate the age of the universe. Think about it, since the Hubble constant corresponds to the rate at which the universe is expanding, the universe must have been smaller in the past (in space and time). Taken to the extreme, this is observational evidence for the beginning of our universe - what is now referred to as the Big Bang. To do this, examine the units of the Hubble constant.
